* **Challenge name**: Security report

* **Challenge description**: Hi, we still got a security report here apparently about some vulnerabilities on our website. We can't remember what it said, neither can we decrypt it. The sender must have used the OpenPGP key from our website, but it doesn't work for us. Usually, Marie Lučanová creates and updates the OpenPGP keys.

* **Hint 2**: BB Industry uses git to push their OpenPGP keys to our website, senork.de...
